1. About how many hours did you contribute to this project?
I worked this project for approximately 5 hours
    a. Setting up the project locally & running npm run dev successfully took 30 mins approxiamtely
    b. Getting the basic UI structure took 30 more mins,
    c. Setting styling on the UI using tailwind css took 1 hr 30 mins more
    d. setting the logic to handle field changes and submit logic took 1 hr more
    e. setting the required validations took another 30 minutes  

2. If you had time to add more features or functions, what would you consider doing?
I would have liked to try more advanced form features as below:
    a. Like displaying 'required' messages right below each of the fields when a certain field is not entered
    b. Like changing the color of the input border to red when undesirable value is entered
    c. Like changing the color of the imput border to green when desirable value is entered
    d. Like disavling the submit button untill all forms fields are correctly submitted 

3. What libraries did you add if any? What are they used for?
I have added & consfigured TailwindCSS cause that is the library that EnergyPal.ca uses.
additionally, I believe that this lib is a good balance of flexibility and out-of-box css features which makes is easier to learn & implement then semantic ui or material ui.

4. Are there any limitations to your implementation? (ex: does not work in IE)
